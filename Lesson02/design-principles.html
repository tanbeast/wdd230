            <p>Imagine dividing your image into nine equal parts with the help of two vertical and two horizontal lines. This is precisely what defines the rule of thirds. Using this grid, you should position your objects along the lines or at the points where they intersect. In the first picture, the woman is positioned along the right vertical line, and her eyes align with the top horizontal line. </p>

            <p>The principle of repetition simply means the reuse of the same or similar elements throughout your design.

                There is a row of games with a title indicating the type of games on each row, and it is repeated many times as you scroll down the page.
                For every game, there is a box, and when you hover over each game, it plays a short clip of that game</p>

            <p>Visual hierarchy is the principle of arranging elements to show their order of importance. a few things to consider are Color, Size, and whitespace among others. <br>A strong visual hierarchy leads users to a page/screenâ€™s functionality and gives them the right visual cues. </p>
