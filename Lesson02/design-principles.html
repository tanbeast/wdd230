            <p>Imagine dividing your image into nine equal parts with the help of two vertical and two horizontal lines. That’s 
                precisely what makes the rule of thirds. Using this grid, you must place your objects along the lines or at the 
                points where they intersect. in the first picture the women is on the right line and her eyes are on the top line.

            <p>The principle of repetition simply means the reusing of the same or similar elements throughout your design.
                <br>1. there is a row of games with a title for what kind of games that are on each row and is is repeated meany times as you scroll down the page. 
                <br>2. for every game there is a box and when you hover over each game is plays a short clip of that game

            <p>Visual hierarchy is the principle of arranging elements to show their order of importance. a few things to consider are Color, Size, and whitespace among others. <br>A strong visual hierarchy leads users to a page/screen’s functionality and gives them the right visual cues. </p>
